# TODO

- Char difference
  - ma - torus
  - ellen - sphere
  - emma - P2

- Wraparound animation of the in the field

- something should be always moving (dancing) in the map
  - maybe it has some silly interaction

- goal denotation at the start of the level
  - denotate what is the goal of the level using cell icons themselves

- history recording

- level, staircase unlocking

- think about making each object more isolated custom element
  - like ajax-view, ajax-form, menu-item
  - jquery plugin is a bit behind of the completely isolated state.
  - they can be made in more isolated way.

- think about the difference and similarity between context-base design and component-base design.
  - now these two overwrap each other very much and the difference is ambiguous.
  - nail down the best practice among the possible balances of these two.

- Ad integration
